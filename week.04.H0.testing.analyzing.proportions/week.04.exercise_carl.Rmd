### ABD book readings ###
Read through chapter 6 and 7. Lecture tuesday will be on testing a null hypothesis, what is a p-value, with concrete examples from the book. 

### R for data science readings #### 

Either you can do all the exercises in this document (to save your answers) or a new one.

The tutorial is from the free book "R for data science" written by the R Overlord Hadley Wickham

URL: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html

- Go through 6. Workflow : scripts (this should be quick as you know the R studio env)
- Go through 7. Exploratory Data Analysis   
try exercises in the chapter 6  & 7  


#### Work on the mammals dataset (resuming the work we started in week 3) 
We will work (again) on the data from 
Nguyen L-P, Galtier N, Nabholz B. 2015 Gene expression, chromosome heterogeneity and the fast-X effect in mammals. Biol. Lett.11 : 20150010.

In week 2 you have made some  basic visual displays of a fraction of the data (the RPKM variable), producing histogram for each species.

Here we continue to work on this dataset and the goal of this R session is to dig deeper in the data vizualization and the data analysis of the paper.

More specifically 2 main goals of this session are :

- To reproduce the Figure 1 of the paper
- To use binomial tests for proportions to test if the genes sitting on X chromosome have atypical patterns of gene expression ( as measured by RPKM) and gene evolution (as measured by dn/ds). Note that these tests are not made as such in the paper where they rely instead on a global linear model (we will come to that in a few weeks, patience ;-))

# Loading the data
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
mammals = read_csv(file = "../datasets/dataset.01.rsbl20150010supp1.csv")

```

# Gene expression and its pattern of covariation with dn/ds in the mammals dataset. 

## Q1: Create a new dataset that contains means per chromosome of dn/ds and log10(RPKM+1)

Recall that we did a new variable called "expression" that is the log10(RPKM+1)

```{r}

mammals = mammals %>% 
  mutate(log10RPKM = log10(RPKM+1))

mammals_meta = mammals %>% 
  group_by(chr, Species, chrMark) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dNdS = mean(dNdS), mean_logRPKM = mean(log10RPKM))
  

```


Hint: adapt the code you used when obtaining the mean, median and standard deviation of the expression for each Species.

```{r}



```

##Q2: Reproduce the figure 1 of the paper where the covariation between dN/dS and RPKM is visualized.
Hint: geom_smooth() can be used in ggplot to add regression lines (lookup/ resuse examples of the r for data science book)

```{r}

ggplot(mammals_meta, aes(mean_logRPKM, mean_dNdS, color = Species, shape = chrMark)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill = NA) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "species") +
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "chromosomes") +
  labs(x = "mean RPKM", y = "dN/dS")
  



```
## Q3: Are genes on the X more often lowly expressed ?
For each species in the dataset:

 
 * Calculate the number (and proportion) of genes that are in the lower 15% range of gene expression for each chromosome. Note that the 15% cutoff value you should use is species specific.
```{r}


mammals_lowmeta = mammals %>% 
  group_by(Species, chr, chrMark) %>% 
  summarise(cutoff = quantile(log10RPKM, .15),
            n = n(),
            n_low = length(log10RPKM[log10RPKM < cutoff])) %>% 
  mutate(ratio = n_low / n)



```
 
 
 
 * test if the X chromosome has a higher proportion of genes in the lower 15% of expression relative to the rest of the genome.  Hint. Adapt the book ABD example of the binomial test for a proportion (Example 7.2 Sex and the X).
```{r}
# Let's start out by visualizing the data a bit.
ggplot(filter(mammals_lowmeta), aes(ratio, fill = chrMark)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  facet_wrap(Species~.)

#I see no trend.
# Anyway, let's make a test

mammals_lowmeta %>% 
  group_by(Species, chrMark) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n), n_low = sum(n_low)) %>% 
  mutate(ratio = n_low / n)

```
```{r}
# test for chimpanzee
binom.test(5, 32, p = 289/1876)
```


* Try a different cutoff for "low gene expression" (say 5%), and examine how sample size, difference between X vs rest and p values are affected by the change of threshold.

* bonus question: if we restrict ourselves to subset of the (15%) low expression genes, what proportion of these genes have a high dn/ds (use the quantiles of the dn/ds distribution to decide on a cutoff), and is this proportion significantly different between autosomes and the X ?
